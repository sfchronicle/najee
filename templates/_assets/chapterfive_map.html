  <h2>Tracking Najee Harris' recruitment</h2>
  <p>Antioch High's Najee Harris, the nation's consensus No. 1 recruit, has fielded scholarship offers from nearly every major college football program in the nation. He verbally committed to Alabama as a high school sophomore in April 2015, but he has kept his recruitment open and made unofficial visits to several top schools this past summer. Harris can't officially commit until national signing day on Feb. 1.</p>

	  			<p>Cal won eight games last season, including the Armed Forces Bowl, two years after going 1-11 in Sonny Dykes' first season in Berkeley. The Bears, still seeking their first Rose Bowl appearance since 1959, enjoyed a renaissance under Jeff Tedford in the mid-2000s, producing several future NFL stars, most notably: Aaron Rodgers, Marshawn Lynch and DeSean Jackson.</p>
